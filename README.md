## What is ModularPress

ModularPress is **not a theme** and **not a plugin marketplace**.

It is a focused CMS admin panel where content, users and configuration are separated into clear, independent modules with a single responsibility.

Instead of plugin driven complexity, ModularPress provides:
- Predictable admin structure
- Clean and explicit configuration
- Long term stability for real production systems

ModularPress was built from operational needs, not marketing requirements.
It is used in long running projects where stability, security and clarity matter more than visual builders or short term flexibility.

## Core Principles

ModularPress is built around a small set of strict principles:

### Clarity
- No hidden behavior
- No implicit dependencies
- Clear admin navigation and responsibilities

### Modularity
- Each module is independent
- Modules can be enabled or disabled without breaking others
- No global plugin chaos

### Predictability
- Consistent admin structure across all modules
- Same navigation logic everywhere
- Editors and admins always know where things are

### Performance
- Lightweight PHP 8.x architecture
- Optimized SQL queries
- No legacy framework core

### Control
- Runs on your own server
- No cloud lock-in
- No external runtime dependencies

---

## How ModularPress Works

Each module in ModularPress is fully independent and includes:
- Its own database tables
- Its own permissions and roles
- Its own admin screens
- Clear boundaries to other modules

There are **no hidden dependencies** between modules and no global plugin state.

This makes ModularPress suitable for:
- Long term maintained projects
- Internal tools
- Structured websites
- Multi-role admin systems

## From Installation to Live Content

ModularPress runs entirely on your own infrastructure.

### 1. Install on your server
Upload the project, run the installer and create your first admin account.
Connect your database and log in within minutes.

### 2. Enable only the modules you need
Switch on Users, Posts, Menus, SEO or optional modules from a single control screen.
Keep the admin clean and focused.

### 3. Invite your team and publish
Add roles, invite editors and start publishing content.
Fine grained permissions keep the system secure without extra plugins.
